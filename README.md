**Problem Statement:** <br />
You have a company of shoes with 3 very large machines, and you
wish to minimize the total cost of production.
The total cost of production of each machine is: <br />
A)𝐶𝐴 = 0.1𝑃𝐴2 + 0.5𝑃𝐴 + 0.1 <br />
B)𝐶𝐵 = 0.3𝑃𝐵 + 0.5 <br />
C)𝐶𝐶 = 0.01𝑃𝐶3 <br />
where <br />
𝐶 is the cost of production of 𝑃 products for each machine <br />
In the next month, you have a
demand of 10,000 shoes . What is
the number of products that should be assigned to each machine
in order to minimize the total cost
